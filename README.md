**🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction – Regression Analysis Project**
A data science project that explores factors influencing restaurant ratings using regression models. Using publicly available restaurant datasets, this analysis identifies key drivers of customer satisfaction and business performance.

🔹 **Objectives**

* Clean and preprocess restaurant review and metadata
* Explore correlations between variables (e.g., pricing, cuisine, location, service)
* Build and evaluate multiple regression models to predict ratings

🔹 **Technologies Used**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
* Jupyter Notebook for EDA and modeling workflow

🔹 **Key Results**

* Achieved an R² score of **0.82** using Lasso Regression
* Identified binary features (alcohol?, good for kids? etc) + numeric features (review_count, price_range) as top predictors
* Visualized feature importance and model performance across techniques

🔹 **Impact**
Provides actionable insights for restaurant owners on what factors most influence customer ratings. This project builds foundational skills in regression, data cleaning, and model tuning.
